I’m a graduating senior at Columbia interested in using modern statistical and machine learning methods to understand complex biological systems at scale. I'm especially drawn to problems in neuroscience and biotechnology where theory and computation meet real-world application. Over the past few years, I’ve done some work on building self-supervised models of primate visual processing and convolutional neural networks for astrophysical data, among other things. 

**Update (April 2025):** This site is still largely a work in progress. Over the next few months, I'll begin using it to write brief (mostly technical) posts about things I'm studying, and to point to various side projects. 

Until then, feel free to look through the CV tab, and to reach out if you're interested! (I'm currently looking for research opportunities, particularly in computational biology or neuroscience.)
